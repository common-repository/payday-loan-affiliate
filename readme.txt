== Description ==
Earn money by generating leads with your wordpress website. 
This plugin adds a Payday Loan form to your site that you can customize in many ways. 
People who want a loan will fill in and submit this form, thus generating leads that your site will send to the WinWinHost Affiliate Network, where the information will be validated and we will pay you for each valid lead.
To use this plugin you need a publisher account on the <a href="http://affiliate.winwinhost.com/publisher-sign-up.php">WinWinHost Affiliate Network</a>


== Installation ==
1. The plugin contains two forms: a small one with just 5 fields (First/Last Name, State, Zip Code, Email) that submits to a large one with many more fields.The reason for this is that the visitor should see the small form at start so he doesn't get scared off by all the details he must submit.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. After activating the plugin a page will be created: "Payday Loan" that it contains the shortcode for the large form, "[leads_form]", that you can use in any page.
4. Please make sure you check that the URL of the page with the large form shortcode and the "Large Form URL" in Settings --> Payday Loan Affiliate are the same.
5. The small form can be used as a widget (recommended) that you will find in Appearence --> Widgets and it's called "Payday Loan Affiliate Small Form".
6. The small form also has a shortcode you can use in posts/pages: "[leads_smallform]".
7. You can check your WinWinHost Affiliate Network publisher account periodically to see how many leads your site has generated and to see the cash in your earnings.
